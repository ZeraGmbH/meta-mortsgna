# Since systemd 240 LANG="C.UTF-8" is set if no /etc/locale.conf
# is found and mentions that 'This locale is supported by various
# distributions' and 'upstream glibc is going to make it available too' [1].
#
# And oe-core makes situation worse by setting default locale to 'C' (although
# I aske for a change and was ignored as ususal [2]).

# Either default so is not a good idea:
#
# * german Umlaute cannot be displayed anymore
# * at least menulibre does not start anymore and complains with
#   | File "/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/menulibre/MenulibreApplication.py", line 390, in configure_application_actions
#   |    label=_('Add _Launcher���'),
#   | UnicodeDecodeError: 'locale' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 13: decoding error
#
# so set locale default - all our images contain en_US

LANG=en_US.UTF-8
