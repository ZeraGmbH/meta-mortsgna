These are tasks are planned:

OE:
* Introduce security_flags.inc
* Get rid of gold - the only adavantage I see is for sending patches: Recipes
  passing with gold are likely to pass for other linkers

Scripts:
* get rid of bashisms
* dialog -> ncurses?
* simple layer-setup layer-pull layer-info scripts
