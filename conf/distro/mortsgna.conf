# With Angstrom we had DISTRO_TYPE = "debug"/"release". No recipe except
# good old lxdm takes care (yes it was me). OE-Core way is setting
# "debug-tweaks" in IMAGE_FEATURES. So if one wants to login with lxdm as
# root set below in your local.conf:
# DISTRO_TYPE = "debug"

# Set the toolchain type (internal, external) and brand (generic, csl etc.)

# do some packagegroup-base stuff here
# packagegroup-boot: no need to comment
# packagegroup-base: merge machine and distro features / enable DISTRO_EXTRA_RRECOMMENDS

# less: makes journalctl readable / coloured

# This also hooks into packagegroup-base, but isn't mandatory.
# If you don't want parts of this in your packagegroup-base using images you can put this in the image recipe:
# BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS = "avahi-daemon avahi-autoipd"
# Note that BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS is a feature of rootfs_ipk.bbclass, not angstrom
#
# os-release: Distro release info on target
# kernel modules: ship fs modules so you can mount stuff and af-packet so networking works
# avahi: makes finding your device on the network a lot easier
# openssh-sftp-server: provides sftp which combined with avahi makes it real easy to use things like sshfs
# DEBUG_APPS: ship strace and procpc to make simple debugging a lot easier
